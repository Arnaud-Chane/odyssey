Features to include in your website:

Required features:

    A navigation bar on each page, structured as a list using the ul and li tags, linked to relevant pages in your website

    A hero section on the home page (index.html) displaying a heading welcoming users to the site (try including a CSS background-image or background-color)

    A ‘Royal Family’ page, displaying the top 3 members of the royal family, placed side by side (Hint: try using Flexbox for the positioning)

    An HTML table displaying the kingdom’s royal assets or a royal sporting event schedule (You're free to be creative here!)

    A contact page with a form (to contact the kingdom) with explicit <labels> (Hint: Use the “for” attribute on the label element, linking it to the id of the input field)

    To be sure to have a clean, robust and compliant HTML code, we ask you to pass all HTML pages into the W3C validator https://validator.w3.org. No any errors should remain.

    A popup message upon submission of the form (using the JavaScript alert method)

    Include a Google font to spruce up the page (Recommended guide)
